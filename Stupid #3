The Ingham had just finished gobbling up his favorite meal, Serucila Macaroni. It has a very strong taste since it is made by
crushing and squishing a rare creature known as the Serucila Bug. After extracting the gooey mush from the bug, he would add
pieces of bamboo to the mix, and stir. This specific meal always feuled him up; it kept him at maximum energy. It was exactly
what he needed toattain his revenge.

The Ingham crossed several miles, desperately searching for the Acorn. His greatest desire was to find the justice he has been
robbed of, to finally realize his goal of vengance. So with a spear in his hands, and a goal set in his mind, he set out to 
locate his target and be at peace once again.
